  Uncompromising quality
  Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest and processing,
  we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the
  coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast
  consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.
