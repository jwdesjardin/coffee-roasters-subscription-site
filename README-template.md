## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Make selections to create a coffee subscription and see an order summary modal of their choices

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

### placing images in divs has some benefits

margins will expect how you would expect
shifting and flexing will work how you would expect
see commitment imagebox

```js
<div className={styles.commitment_imagebox}>
	<img src='/assets/about/mobile/image-commitment.jpg' alt='' />
</div>
```

### practical use of an ::after element

### dynamic background-image hero component using inline jsx styles

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### cascading margin-bottom on each structure of the component

```css
.quality_imagebox {
	max-height: 400px;
	margin-bottom: 48px;
	border-radius: 12px;
	overflow: hidden;
}
.quality_textcontent {
	margin-bottom: 61px;
	h2 {
		font-size: var(--md-header-fs);
		margin-bottom: 30px;
	}
	p {
		font-size: var(--md-body-fs);
	}
}
```

so in the quality element i have margin on the bottom of the image, the header, and the bottom of the content div. Not shown here i also have margin bottom on the entire container for this component. I liked using margin bottom in this way because it keeps things spaced in a easy to maintain way instead of having one component with both a margin top and bottom that may have conflicting margin tops and bottoms with another compoenet.

### Continued development
